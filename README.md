# N-Queen-Algo-GUI
This a graphical representaion of the classical N-Queen problem. 
The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. 
For example, following is a solution for 4 Queen problem. The expected output is a binary matrix which has 1s for the blocks where queens are placed.

The program uses back-tracking algorithm to successfully implement n-queen problem. 

To implement the graphical portion, "graphics.h" head is used. C graphics using graphics.h functions can be used to draw different shapes, display text in different fonts, change colors and many more. 


If "graphics.h not found" error occurs, refer:
